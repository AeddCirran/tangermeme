Release History
===============


Version 0.1.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- This is the first major release of tangermeme and contains the first version of the core functionality.


ersatz
------

	- This module implements common sequence manipulation methods such as substitutions, insertions, deletions, and shufflings of sequences.


predict
-------

	- This module implements efficient batched prediction that can handle models that accept multiple inputs or multiple outputs.


marginalize
-----------

	- This module implements marginalization experiments, where predictions are made for a set of sequences, a motif is substituted into the middle, and then new predictions are made for the new sequences.


space
-----
	
	- This module implements spacing experiments where predictions are made for a set of sequences, a set of motifs are inserted with a given spacing, and then new predictions are made for the new sequences.


io
---

	- This module implements I/O functions for common data types as well as for extracting examples for machine learning models.


ism
---

	- This module implements in silico saturated mutagenesis (ISM).


variant_effect
--------------

	- This module implements functions for evaluating the marginal effect of variants on model predictions.


Version 0.0.1
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Initial release
