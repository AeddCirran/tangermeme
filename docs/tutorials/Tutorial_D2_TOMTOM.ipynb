    "### Tutorial D2 (Built-in Tools): TOMTOM\n",
    "\n",
    "`FIMO` is a tool for taking a set of PWMs and scanning them against a set of one-hot encoded sequences; in contrast, `TOMTOM` is a tool for comparing pairs of PWMs to determine their similarity. Classically, tools like `TOMTOM` are used to identify redundancies in motif databases and to estimate similarities between binding profiles of proteins. However, `TOMTOM` is also frequently used by researchers who see motifs that are highlighted by some method (such as attributions from machine learning models) and need to know what that motif corresponds to. In this manner, `TOMTOM` serves as a useful automatic annotation tool for discoveries made using `tangermeme`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although at first glance `FIMO` and `TOMTOM` appear similar because they involve comparing motifs with something to identify statistical similarities, the difference between operating on long one-hot encoded sequences and a second motif require large methodological changes. First, calculating a background distribution for `FIMO` can be done exactly because you know that the sequences being scanned are limited to being one-hot encoded, whereas the background distribution for `TOMTOM` must be empirically calculated from the set of provided motifs. Second, because motifs are much shorter than the sequences usually being scanned by `FIMO`, the best alignment between two motifs likely involve some amount of overhang on either end of the alignment. Calculating scores and p-values in a manner that don't automatically undervalue imperfect alignments is non-trivial. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about `TOMTOM`, I'd suggest reading [the original paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2007-8-2-r24) and the [subsequent follow-up work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21543443/) that improves the calculation of p-values for alignments with overhangs."

    "#### Using TOMTOM\n",
    "\n",
    "One can run the `TOMTOM` algorithm by calling the `tomtom` function on a pair of lists, where both lists are PWMs that are each of shape `(len(alphabet), motif_length)`. The background distribution is built primarily using the targets, so make sure that the first list is the queries you want to evaluate and the second list is the target distribution you want to match against. For example, if you want to score a single one-hot encoded sequence, you can do the following:"

    "When one uses the MEME suite webserver to run TOMTOM, they may notice that it takes several seconds to run a single query against a target database. Although the command-line tool is faster (as jobs do not need to be submitted, queued, and then wait for available resources), one may still wonder if it is possible to do large-scale comparisons with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of `TOMTOM` in `tangermeme` scales significantly better than the command-line tool (though you might notice it takes a few seconds for numba to load initially due to some issues there). There are several reasons for this but perhaps the most notable are built in multithreading through numba and caching null distributions for each target length, rather than having to recalculate them for each query-target pair. These efficiencies significantly speed up the implementation in `tangerememe` without compromising on the exactness. However, importantly, other speed improvements (approximate medians, binning similar targets) further speed up the algorithm but do slightly alter the results. In practice, there is very little observed difference, but this is why you may not see identical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a quick timing test comparing the 1646 motifs in the JASPAR set against themselves. This involves doing 1646x1646x2 comparisons, with the x2 being because we are also doing reverse complement comparisons."

    "Looks like it only takes ~10s, which is 10x faster than you might expect, since we expected the calculation to be ~100x slower. This performance is mostly explained by the target column binning feature, where repeated columns (or those whose probability vectors are close, but not identical) are merged and calculation does not happen for them. Since each column in the target set now has 10 exact copies, it may not be surprising to see that the target axis does not matter as much for the calculations. However, this is an important point because as target databases get larger, *they get more redundant*. So, while we may not see speed improvements as large as we saw here, we will still see time only increase *sublinearly* with the number of targets."
